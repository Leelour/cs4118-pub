        <h5>Preface</h5>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> is a distribution
            of GNU/Linux with a philosophy that emphasizes simplicity and user
            control. However, this means that users themselves must put in an
            effort to shape their Arch installation as they see fit. Thankfully,
            <a href="http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Main_Page">Arch
            Linux</a> has a large community supporting it and tons of guides
            to help walk you through even the obscure features of the
            distribution. This guide will point you to Arch guides detailing
            how to setup your system and detail any modifications necessary
            to get it to work on VMware Workstation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>We recommend you use a virtual machine manager for this class,
            instead of developing directly on your machine. If you use your
            own machine, you may risk data loss/corruption in some assignments
            of this course.</i>
        </p>

        <h5 data-magellan-destination="step0" id="step0" class="marker">A</h5>

        <h5>Step 0</h5>
        <p>
            First, you should download and install <a
            href="http://www.vmware.com/products/ws/">VMware
            Workstation</a> for Windows or Linux, or <a
            href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/">VMware Fusion</a> for
            Mac. A <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~crf/accounts/">CS
            account</a> will provide access to <a
            href="http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/crf/software/vmware">VMware
            licenses</a> and software at no additional cost. Guides for
            installing VMware products on your platform are just a Google
            search away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, grab the <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/download/">Arch
            Linux ISO</a>. To begin the installation process, start VMware
            Workstation/Fusion and make a new virtual machine (File -> New
            Virtual Machine). The new window will walk you through configuring
            the virutal hardware and selecting the ISO. For the hardware,
            we suggest:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>64 GB (dynamic, single file) disk</li>
            <li>At least 2 GB RAM</li>
            <li>At least 2 cores</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once you've booted into the Arch Live CD, proceed to Step 1.
        </p>

        <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <p>
            Now you're ready to install Arch Linux. Arch recently abandoned
            its <code>ncurses</code> based installation (circa 2012);
            installation is done entirely by a series of commands. The <a
            href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners'_Guide">Beginner's
            Guide</a> walks you through the entire process, so follow those
            steps, but here are some suggestions/modifications:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Since our networking hardware is fixed, DHCP is all
                we need.</li>
            <li>Make 3 partitions: one <code>ext4</code> partition,
                one <code>swap</code> partition, and one <code>jfs</code>
                partition. The <code>ext4</code> partition is where
                you'll be doing most of the work, so make it large. The
                <code>swap</code> partiion might need to be large,
                depending on how much RAM you allocated your VM. 4 GB
                should be enough. The <code>jfs</code> partition is for
                later assignments; 1023 MB or more is suggested.</li>
            <li>You should install the following package (groups):
                <code>base, base-devel, multilib-devel, linux-lts,
                linux-lts-headers</code>. The
                <code>multilib-devel</code> group is from the <a
                href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Multilib">
                multilib</a> repository; you will need to enable it as
                it is disabled by default. When it asks you to confirm
                the package selection, make sure to not install
                <code>linux</code> from <code>base</code>. If you do, it's
                not an issue; you can remove it later or not use it.</li>
            <li>Don't worry about kernel modules yet, we'll deal with
                those later.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We suggest making another user, so you don't always log in as
            root. Additionally, you may want a graphical interface, but we'll
            need to setup our video drivers first.
        </p>
